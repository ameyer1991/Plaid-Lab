# plaid-my-first-app

Welcome to the first Plaid Lab!
In this lab session, you'll learn the basics of coding and then get to apply your knowledge to change a bit of code in an existing app.

Let's get started:



## Prerequisites
- Mac laptop
- Download and Install Code Editor: [Atom](https://atom.io/)

## Getting Started
- Download and save [codelab.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pvc074u9g1ybcxk/codelab2.zip?dl=0) (from Dropbox) to your desktop. 
Look for the '**Download**' button in the top-right corner

- Open the zip file (double click) and you should see a '**codelab**' folder which contains the pre-packaged app we'll be using for this session.
  * The **codelab** folder should be on your desktop, if not, move it from your 'Downloads' folder
  * Chrome (browser) may alert you to the file being dangerous and ask if you want to discard it. Click on '**Keep It**'
