# plaid-my-first-app

Welcome to the first Plaid Lab!
In this lab session, you'll learn the basics of coding and then get to apply your knowledge to change a bit of code in an existing app.

Let's get started:



## Prerequisites
- Mac laptop
- Download and Install Code Editor: [Atom](https://atom.io/)

## Getting Started
1. Download and save [codelab.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pvc074u9g1ybcxk/codelab2.zip?dl=0) (from Dropbox) to your desktop. 
Look for the '**Download**' button in the top-right corner

2. Open the zip file (double click) and you should see a '**codelab**' folder which contains the pre-packaged app we'll be using for this session.
  * The '**codelab**' folder should be on your desktop, if not, move it from your '**Downloads**' folder
  * Chrome (browser) may alert you to the file being dangerous and ask if you want to discard it. Click on '**Keep It**'

3. Open the Terminal using these keys: Command+Space; type “terminal”; press Enter)
 * The Terminal will let you run the app we’re using in this codelab
 * You run commands by typing the instructions below and pressing Enter

4. Run this command in the Terminal: `cd ~/Desktop/codelab`
 * It will tell the Terminal to look in the '**codelabs**' folder you’ve just unzipped on your desktop

5. Go to http://localhost:8001 in your Chrome browser
 * The browser is where your web app will be displayed for you to see
 * You should see a website that says “Plaid Quickstart” at the top
